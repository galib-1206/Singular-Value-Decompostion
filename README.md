Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix. It
generalizes the eigen decomposition of a square normal matrix with an orthonormal eigen
basis.Â 

The singular value decomposition of a matrix A is the factorization of A into the
product of three matrices A = UDV^T where the columns of U and V are orthonormal and
the matrix D is diagonal with positive real entries.
